# Introduction

https://cocktailnodeapi.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple web app where a user can type in a drink they would like a recipe for and the drink name, image, and recipe will be displayed on the page. 
This application uses the cocktailDB API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to fetch drink data based on drink name (e.g. using user input 'margarita' 
will fetch www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita).

# How it's made

Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, HTML5, CSS3, EJS
